; A343252: a(n) is the least k0 <= n such that v_7(n), the 7-adic order of n, can be obtained by the formula: v_7(n) = log_7(n / L_7(k0, n)), where L_7(k0, n) is the lowest common denominator of the elements of the set S_7(k0, n) = {(1/n)*binomial(n, k), with 0 < k <= k0 such that k is not divisible by 7} or 0 if no such k0 exists.
